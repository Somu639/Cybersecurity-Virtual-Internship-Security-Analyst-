# Cybersecurity-Virtual-Internship-Security-Analyst-
Security Analyst
Description

You are working as a security analyst for El Banco Bank, where your primary responsibility is to implement best practices to secure the organization’s assets. 

You are reviewing the password policy for internal users and realize that it is outdated and has not been updated in the last five years. Therefore, it does not align with the latest recommendations published by PCI DSS, NIST, and CIS. 

The organization currently does not use multi-factor authentication. Users are encouraged to use password managers authorized by the organization to store passwords. 

Your goal is to review and update the organization’s password policy settings to comply with the latest security requirements. Since the bank processes credit cards, you need to ensure that the password policy complies with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) security requirements.

However, PCI DSS encourages referring to other industry standards. Therefore, you have decided to compare PCI DSS requirements with NIST and CIS recommendations.
